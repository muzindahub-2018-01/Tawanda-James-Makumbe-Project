<h1> FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT TRACK</h1>

</header>
<div id = "wrapper1">

<p>Front end web development is the practice of producing  <em><b> HTML, CSS and usually JavaScript </b></em> for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. <br>The challenge associated with front-end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing. </p>

<h2> HTML</h2>
<p><b>HTML</b>(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).<br>
Advantages of HTML:
<ul>
<li>It is widely used.</li>
<li>Every browser supports HTML language.</li>
<li>Easy to learn and use.</li>
<li>It is by default in every windows so you don't need to purchase extra software.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class = "column">
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files<br>
This approach has several advantages:
<ul>
<li>Maintenance:It is much easier to maintain the appearance of a Web site.</li>
<li>Functionality:CSS provides rich functionality, including defining the appearance of HTML pages when they are printed.</li>
<li>Accessibility:Use of CSS provides much greater accessibility, allowing users with special needs to alter the appearance of a Web page to suit their requirements.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><b>JavaScript</b> is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages
The core JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:
<ul>
<li>Store useful values inside variables. </li>
<li>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).</li>
<li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. </li>
</ul> </p>
